BAGHDAD -- Iraq on Thursday received a third batch of COVID-19 vaccines donated by the Chinese government amid a surge in coronavirus infections due to the spread of the Delta variant.

Charge d'Affaires of the Chinese Embassy in Iraq Jian Fangning and Iraqi health officials attended a handover ceremony held at Baghdad International Airport.

"Iraq and China are close friends and good partners," Jian said during the ceremony. "We are sure it will build a strong defense for the Iraqi people and government to curb the pandemic."

Ali al-Baldawi, director-general of the Iraqi State Company for Marketing Drugs and Medical Appliances, said that the entry of larger quantities of vaccines into Iraq means that more Iraqis will receive the jab, which will have a significant impact in curbing the disease's spread.

The latest Chinese donation came as the Iraqi Ministry of Health reported on Thursday 10,234 new COVID-19 cases, raising the nationwide caseload to 1,751,176.

Iraq received the first two batches of COVID-19 vaccines donated by the Chinese government in March and April respectively.
